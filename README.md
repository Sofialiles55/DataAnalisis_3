# Delivery 3: In-editor visualization
The aim of this delivery was to create a data visualization toolkit inside Unity that allows gameplay events to be inspected directly in the editor, while
also providing ways to interact with and filter the data and secondly, to create a pipeline where we can export said data to our server using php, MySQL and fileZilla.
